Every week I'll take a look at my Last.fm profile and write a post about the music I've been listening to. This week a lot of legendary black-metal bands and new Torche songs.

The last week I've been reading the excellent book _Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult by Dayal Patterson_. The book dives deep into the black-metal scene, with tons information and interviews with bands and musicians who were there at the birth of the genre. I'm really enjoying the stories and interviews with a lot of bands I used to listen to or still follow.

Going through the chapters of Mayhem, Thorns and Emperor I had the urge to start blasting their albums again. I had not listened to the Thorns vs Emperor split in more than ten years. Reading about it made me pick it up again. The Thorns songs are the most interesting part of the album.
