[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a static blog generator and sometimes known as the hacker way to blog. Writing posts on the command line, your favourite text-editor or directly on Github might be awesome, but if you want to write a blog on a device without access to these tools you would be out of luck. Luckily there is [Prose.io](http://www.prose.io), a way to manage your Jekyll blog on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through your browser.

Prose isn't new, actually it wad started a couple of years ago. But it has been improved throughout the years. Looking at screenshots of how Prose used to look, I must say the Prose interface and UX anno 2015 looks much improved.
