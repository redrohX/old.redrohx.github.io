[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a static blog generator and known as the hacker way to blog. Writing posts on the command line, your favourite text-editor or directly on Github might be awesome, but if you want to write a blog on a device without access to these tools you would be out of luck. Luckily there is [Prose.io](http://www.prose.io), a way to manage your Jekyll blog on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the browser.

Prose isn't a new tool, but it was exactly the tool I've been looking for and I think that's awesome. Also considering it seems to work pretty well.
