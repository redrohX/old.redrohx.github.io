Does anyone else have trouble naming their color variables in Sass? I can't be the only one who has trouble naming variables of more than three different versions of a similar color.

I always end up with `$light-gray`, `$medium-gray`, `$dark-gray` and then find out at the last moment there is another gray. So I end up with `$lighter-gray`, `$lightest-gray`, etc. You get the picture.

Luckily there is a solution (besides not using 50 different shades of gray on your site).

I can't exactly remember where I found out about this nifty online tool, but it's a really cool tool to use if you want to give your color variables an unique name.

`$dark-gray`? Why not call it `$mineshaft`? Or forget about `$pink`, `$sundown` is what you want to use.

Check it out at [Name That Color][NTC].
