As a front-end developer I have the bad habit of planning to build a blog, but never finding the time or energy to
set one up. Last year I dabbled into Ghost and before that I've been checking Wordpress and Jekyll. The latter
always seemed interesting to me. Who needs a database when all he wants is write a bunch of blog posts?

I'm a front-end developer and should at least have a site without a default theme. Around Christmas I started
working on my own blog theme, with the intend to port it to either Ghost or Jekyll. I ended up with the latter, since
this will also save me some time and money on hosting.

### Write, write!
So with a blog comes the responsibility to keep it up to date. Knowning myself I really need to be motivated
to start writing regularly. I have the intention, but sometimes life just keeps me away from these things.

Topics I plan to write about are front-end development in the form of Sass/CSS, the occasional piece about videogames and possibly
about music. You might not like one of these topics, but hey... it's my blog, so start your own if you don't like it.

### Updates
I realize this theme is not 100% finished yet. It doesn't really support old browsers yet, performance can be improved and
I might rewrite some of the Sass. You know, this is a work in progress and also a way to experiment a bit. Knowing me I
might change the theme more than writing blog posts.

Anyway, this is my blog. Welcome and hopefully I will see you back soon (I've already added (the crappy) blog posts from my old blog).

Oh and look at this awesome code snippet styling. I used [PrismJS][1] for it.
<pre><code class="language-scss">
      .class {
        font-size: 1em;
        @include clearfix;
        @extend %placeholder;
      }

</code></pre>
